# SKORR - Score Keeping Object Result Recognition

SKORR is an advanced scorekeeping system for basketball games that utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision techniques. This system is powered by TensorFlow 2, OpenCV, and Python to track scores accurately in real-time, offering a cost-effective and reliable alternative to traditional scorekeeping methods. SKORR was developed as a capstone project during the final year of Computer Engineering Undergrad at McMaster University.

## Features
- Real-time object detection and tracking of players, basketballs, and baskets using computer vision.
- Accurate basket recognition by leveraging a custom-trained machine learning model.
- User-friendly interface to display game scores and relevant information.
- Economical solution with the usage of cost-effective hardware components.
- A scalable and versatile core technology that can potentially be applied to other sports.

## Hardware Used
- **AI Thinker ESP32 development board**: The board is used for the computing and interfacing needed for the system.
- **OV2640 camera module:** This module provides the video source that the system uses for object detection and tracking.


## Usage
With the successful setup and running of SKORR, the system automatically detects and tracks the players, basketball, and baskets, recognizing successful baskets and maintaining a score in real-time. Since the hardware is custom, it may be difficult for most to demo this themselves. Instead, we recommend you check out this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jrU2DCLPMj1nMRd_uSCourWpTaHPK-6U/view?usp=sharing) demonstrating the system.
